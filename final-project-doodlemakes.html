<h2>Last Updated</h2>
<p>The last sprint was sprint 5 in which we created the turtle-draw application. This proposal was last uodated November 8th 2020, which 
is also the last day of Sprint 5.</p>


<h3>Desciption of Doodle Makes</h3>
<p>This application titled, Doodle Makes, will be an html webpage displaying the various forms of artworks that I have created. This webpage will 
display multiple pictures of paintings, sketches, and even doodles from various points in my life. Each painting, doodle, and sketch will have a title 
as well as a brief description of the painting itself. The viewer will be able to look through the artworks easily and effectively.</p>

<h3>Prioritized Desired Features</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Colorful and Appealing background</li>
    <li>Different labelled sections for different forms of art</li>
    <li>Artistic background that the users can view (essentially a personal artistic background)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Unprioritized Desired Features</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Ability for users to comment on the webpage under different artworks</li>
    <li>Multiple pages that the user can click onto</li>
    <li>Ability for users to make requests on artworks they'd like to see done</li>
</ol>

<h3>Languages and Platforms</h3>
<p>I am going to be using html, CSS and possibly GitHub/Azure to implement my project. When it comes to technical features I will be using the
information we learned through the W3 website and teh information from Sprint 3 when we created our getting to know eachother webpages. I will make 
the webpage as aesthetically pleasing and easy to view as possible. When it comes to features that go beyond what we learned in class, that would include 
making a creative background that isn't just a simple color, utilizing different styles and fonts that go with the aesthitic I am trying to create,
and creating a comments section on the webpage.</p>
